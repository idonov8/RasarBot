# RasarBot
A crowd sourced system, dedicated to monitor the rasar situation in an army base

## This project is looking for maintainers/contributors
Please feel free to start with [simple issues](https://github.com/idonov8/RasarBot/contribute).

If you want help setting up the bot locally, send me a message through the [bot](https://t.me/RasarBot) with the `/send_feedback` command. 

## Run locally
#### To run the code locally you'll need to declare the following env variables:
```
MODE='dev'
TOKEN='TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN'
ADMIN_ID=111111111 # The bot's admin chat_id
```
##### Alternatively, you can declare them in a .env file in the same directory
